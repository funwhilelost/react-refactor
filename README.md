# Refactor React

Here's a quick example of refactoring from:

- Big component of stuff [Home.tsx](src/pages/Home.tsx)
- Separate components [StageOne.tsx](src/pages/StageOne.tsx)
- Unidirectional data store (business logic in one place) [StageTwo.tsx](src/pages/StageTwo.tsx)
- Forms combined with unidirectional store [StageThree.tsx](src/pages/StageThree.tsx)

See it running: [https://funwhilelost.github.io/react-refactor](https://funwhilelost.github.io/react-refactor)

## Try it

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
